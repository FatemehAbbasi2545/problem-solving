# merge-strings
A program that receives two sets of strings as input, each set containing 5 strings, then merges the strings together in the following way:
Operations on the first string from the first set and the first string from the second set: The first word of the first string and the first word of the second string are merged together to form a new string and this new string is stored in a new set. The second words of both strings are merged together to form a new string and stored in the new set. The third words of the strings are merged together to form a new word and stored in the new set, and ...
The same operation is repeated for the second, third, fourth and fifth strings.
Finally, the result of the operations is a set of strings.
The final set is displayed in the output.
