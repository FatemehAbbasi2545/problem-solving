# report-server-log
We have a website that logs information about users who request the website, the page requested, and the response status of each request.
Write a program that provides a usable report from the server log. For example, it provides the following:
Which users made requests and how many times each user made requests, which pages were requested and how many times each, the total number of requests, the number of requests that encountered errors, and the error rate.
